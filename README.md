### (c) Janis Stipnieks

### Disclousure
- Assigmnemnt completed within ca 3 hour window with interuptions. As I was working in envoronment that was causing distractions
- Algorithm for randomizing array items was looked up using google. Fisher - Yates shuffle is used in this case
- Readme file and some refactoring of the code pushed to the repo on Sunday. (changes can be seen comparing commits 02 and 03)
- Overall quick and dirty solution, but had fun implemeting it
